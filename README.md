# Customer Targeting with Machine Learning

This repository contains two projects that focus on using machine learning (ML) to target customers with promotional messages. Both projects aim to improve marketing campaign outcomes by identifying optimal strategies for reaching customers effectively.

## Projects Overview

### 1. High-End Steakhouse Targeting
The first project involves targeting customers with promotional messages for a high-end steakhouse deal. The objectives are to estimate a logistic regression model, evaluate different machine learning approaches, and determine the optimal targeting strategy. The project explores various machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, neural networks, and random forests to determine the most effective method for targeting customers.

Key aspects of the High-End Steakhouse project:
- **Goal**: To optimize targeting for a high-end steakhouse promotion, aiming to maximize profit and Return on Marketing Expenditure (ROME).
- **Approaches**: Logistic regression, neural networks, and random forests with cross-validation.
- **Outcomes**: Significant increase in profit and ROME with targeted approaches, with Random Forest with cross-validation showing the best results.

### 2. Targeting Mobile App Messages
The second project focuses on targeting customers via mobile app messages for a promotional karaoke deal. This project examines customer data to identify targeting strategies that reduce the risk of customer attrition due to message fatigue, while maximizing campaign profitability.

Key aspects of the Targeting Mobile App project:
- **Goal**: To determine the true marginal cost of sending mobile app messages and to build targeted campaigns that maximize profitability.
- **Approaches**: Logistic regression and customer segmentation for targeting.
- **Outcomes**: Findings revealed that a targeted approach can significantly improve campaign outcomes and reduce the risk of customer drop-off.

## Outcomes
The results from both projects indicate that targeted approaches using machine learning can lead to substantial improvements in marketing campaign profitability and ROME. The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in optimizing customer targeting strategies.
