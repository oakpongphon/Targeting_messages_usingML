# High-End Steakhouse Deal Analysis

As a new member of Susan Liu's analytics team at Tuango, I was tasked with running and evaluating a new deal for a major high-end steakhouse. Tuango is similar to Groupon, promoting discounted gift certificates for use at local or national retailers. This new project followed the success of the previous Karaoke deal project.

## Project Background
The negotiations with the steakhouse were challenging. The average price per meal at the restaurant was 600 RMB, but Tuango was only able to secure a 25% commission. Susan Liu, the Chief Data Scientist, advised me to consider 12 RMB as the cost for each SMS sent to a customer.

Given this context, my assignment was to estimate a logistic regression model to assess the deal's potential success. The data provided included a training sample and a test sample.

## Additional Analyses and Tasks
The evening before a critical meeting, Susan Liu requested the following additional analyses:

1. **Neural Network Estimation**: A single-layer neural network with one node and regularization of 0.5, using `tanh` and `lbfgs`.
2. **Random Forest Estimation**: A random forest with 100 trees, sampling one feature for each node split.
3. **Model Performance Evaluation**: Assessing profit and Return on Marketing Expenditure (ROME) for all three models (logistic regression, neural network, and random forest) using a gains chart to ensure there was no overfitting.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to conduct these analyses at the last minute to ensure the success of the meeting with the CEO.

## Model Tuning and Further Analysis
Following the meeting, Susan Liu requested additional model tuning:

- **Neural Network Tuning**: Conducting 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate models with one hidden layer, varying the number of nodes (1, 2, 3, and 4) and regularization (0, 0.5, 1). The goal was to determine if the original neural network structure was optimal.
- **Random Forest Tuning**: Similarly, applying 5-fold cross-validation over a grid with 100, 200, and 300 trees, and sampling 1, 2, or 3 features for each node split.

Both cross-validations aimed to evaluate model performance using Area Under the Curve (AUC). I reported the best model specifications for both the neural network and the random forest.

## Results and Outcomes

After implementing the analysis for the high-end steakhouse deal, the following outcomes were observed in terms of campaign profit and Return on Marketing Expenditure (ROME):

### Campaign Profit by Targeting Strategy

The bar chart above shows the profit generated by the campaign under various targeting strategies:

- The **No targeting** approach yielded a profit of 551,498 RMB.
- The **Logit (Logistic Regression)** approach significantly increased profit to 946,827 RMB.
- **Neural Networks (NN)** and **Random Forest (RF)** approaches yielded similar profits of 954,370 RMB and 1,417,739 RMB, respectively.
- The **Random Forest Cross-Validation AUC (RF CV AUC)** strategy generated the highest profit of 1,510,566 RMB.

This outcome demonstrates that a targeted approach using machine learning models, particularly Random Forest, can substantially increase campaign profitability.

### ROME by Campaign Strategy

This bar chart illustrates the Return on Marketing Expenditure (ROME) for each targeting strategy:

- **No targeting** had a ROME of 18.38%.
- The **Logit (Logistic Regression)** approach significantly improved ROME to 53.38%.
- **Neural Networks (NN)** showed a similar ROME to Logit, at 53.81%.
- **NN with Cross-Validation AUC (NN CV AUC)**, and **RF** achieved ROME values of 79.94% and 81.57%, respectively.
- **RF CV AUC** showed the highest ROME at 85.17%.

These results indicate that machine learning models, especially those optimized through cross-validation, can dramatically increase the return on marketing expenditures.

### Conclusion
The results from these analyses show that a targeted approach using advanced machine learning techniques can significantly improve both profit and ROME compared to non-targeted strategies. Among the various models, Random Forest with cross-validation was the most effective in terms of profitability and ROME, suggesting its potential as the optimal targeting approach for future campaigns.
